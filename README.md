# Evolcon Widget Library

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

#### Qlik Sense Dektop
1. Download the package and unzip it.
2. Copy the new folder to this location: C:/Users/?????/Documents/Qlik/Sense/Extensions/.

#### Qlik Sense Server
Although widget libraries can be imported from both QMC and Dev Hub, the uniqueness check of a widget is only performed when importing from Dev Hub. Therefore, we strongly recommended you import all widget libraries from Dev Hub.

1. Download the ZIP file.
2. Open the Qlik Dev Hub. On the start page, click **+** and select **Import widget library**.
3. Locate the ZIP file containing the widget library to import and then click **Open**.

## Demo App
Don't forget to check the demo app included in this package. It contains some examples of all the widgets in the library.
