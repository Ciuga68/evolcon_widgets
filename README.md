# Evolcon Widget Library

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

#### Qlik Sense Dektop
To install, copy all files in the .zip file to folder "C:\Users[%Username%]\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions\"

#### Qlik Sense Server
Although widget libraries can be imported from both QMC and Dev Hub, the uniqueness check of a widget is only performed when importing from Dev Hub. Therefore, we strongly recommended you import all widget libraries from Dev Hub.

1. Download the ZIP file.
2. Open the Qlik Dev Hub.
3. On the Dev Hub start page, click **+** and select **Import widget library**.
4. Locate the ZIP file containing the widget library to import and then click **Open**.
5. The imported widget library can now be accessed from Dev Hub.
